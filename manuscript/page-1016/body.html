<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">protection.</p><p>"Dearest Master! Rebuke me a million times-do scold me now!"</p><p>"I shall chide you no more." His divine voice was grave, yet with an undercurrent of laughter. "You and I shall smile together, so long as our two forms appear different in the _maya_-dream of God. Finally we shall merge as one in the Cosmic Beloved; our smiles shall be His smile, our unified song of joy vibrating throughout eternity to be broadcast to God-tuned souls!"</p><p>Sri Yukteswar gave me light on certain matters which I cannot reveal here. During the two hours that he spent with me in the Bombay hotel room he answered my every question. A number of world prophecies uttered by him that June day in 1936 have already come to pass.</p><p>"I leave you now, beloved one!" At these words I felt Master melting away within my encircling arms.</p></div> </div>
