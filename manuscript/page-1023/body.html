To him that overcometh will I grant to sit with me in my throne, even as I also overcame, and am set down with my Father in his throne."-<em>Revelation</em> 3:12, 21.</p><p>❁ Sri Yukteswar was signifying that, even as in his earthly incarnation he had occasionally assumed the weight of disease to lighten his disciples' karma, so in the astral world his mission as a savior enabled him to take on certain astral karma of dwellers on Hiranyaloka, and thus hasten their evolution into the higher causal world.</p><p>❁ Life and death as relativities of thought only. <em>Vedanta</em> points out that God is the only Reality; all creation or separate existence is <em>maya</em> or illusion. This philosophy of monism received its highest expression in the <em>Upanishad</em> commentaries of Shankara.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
