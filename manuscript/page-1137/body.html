It is the world of my own vision, in the making of which I hoped to bear my little part, and now . . .</p><p>"Perhaps in the body I shall never reach your golden shores nor worship in your temple. But it is something and more, to have had the vision and know that in the midst of war there is still a peace that abides in your harbors and among your hills. Greetings to all the Fellowship from a common soldier, written on the watchtower waiting for the dawn."</p></div> </div>
