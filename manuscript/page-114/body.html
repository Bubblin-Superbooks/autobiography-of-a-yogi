With a sweeping gesture, my chance companion dismissed the ornate dignity.</p><p>"Bricks and mortar sing us no audible tune; the heart opens only to the human chant of being."</p><p>We strolled to the inviting sunshine at the entrance, where throngs of devotees were passing to and fro.</p><p>"You are young." The sage surveyed me thoughtfully. "India too is young. The ancient <em>rishis</em>  laid down ineradicable patterns of spiritual living. Their hoary dictums suffice for this day and land. Not outmoded, not unsophisticated against the guiles of materialism, the disciplinary precepts mold India still. By millenniums-more than embarrassed scholars care to compute!-the skeptic Time has validated Vedic worth. Take it for your heritage."</p></div> </div>
