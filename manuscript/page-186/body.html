<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><blockquote><p>O Hermit, call thou in the authentic words
Of that old hymn called <em>sama</em>; "Rise! Awake!"
Call to the man who boasts his <em>shastric</em> lore
From vain pedantic wranglings profitless,
Call to that foolish braggart to come forth
Out on the face of nature, this broad earth,
Send forth this call unto thy scholar band;
Together round thy sacrifice of fire
Let them all gather. So may our India,
Our ancient land unto herself return
O once again return to steadfast work,
To duty and devotion, to her trance
Of earnest meditation; let her sit
Once more unruffled, greedless, strifeless, pure,
O once again upon her lofty seat
And platform, teacher of all lands.
