<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">"He is eternal, ever-new Joy!" This memory persisted long after the day of rapture.</p><p>Another early recollection is outstanding; and literally so, for I bear the scar to this day. My elder sister Uma and I were seated in the early morning under a <em>neem</em> tree in our Gorakhpur compound. She was helping me with a Bengali primer, what time I could spare my gaze from the near-by parrots eating ripe margosa fruit. Uma complained of a boil on her leg, and fetched a jar of ointment. I smeared a bit of the salve on my forearm.</p><p>"Why do you use medicine on a healthy arm?"</p><p>"Well, Sis, I feel I am going to have a boil tomorrow. I am testing your ointment on the spot where the boil will appear."</p><p>"You little liar!"</p><p>"Sis, don't call me a liar until you see what happens in the morning." Indignation filled me.</p></div> </div>
