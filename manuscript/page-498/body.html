<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Emperor of Hindustan.</p><p>Many people imagine that every spiritual master has, or should have, the health and strength of a Sandow. The assumption is unfounded. A sickly body does not indicate that a guru is not in touch with divine powers, any more than lifelong health necessarily indicates an inner illumination. The condition of the physical body, in other words, cannot rightfully be made a test of a master. His distinguishing qualifications must be sought in his own domain, the spiritual.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">Numerous bewildered seekers in the West erroneously think that an eloquent speaker or writer on metaphysics must be a master. The rishis, however, have pointed out that the acid test of a master is a man's ability to enter at will the breathless state, and to maintain the unbroken <em>samadhi</em> of <em>nirbikalpa</em> .  Only by these achievements can a human being prove that he has "mastered" <em>maya</em> or the dualistic Cosmic Delusion.</p></div> </div>
