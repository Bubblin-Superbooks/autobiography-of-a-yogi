<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>My customary routine was to set out on my bicycle about nine-thirty in the morning. In one hand I would carry an offering for my guru-a few flowers from the garden of my <em>Panthi</em> boardinghouse. Greeting me affably, Master would invite me to lunch. I invariably accepted with alacrity, glad to banish the thought of college for the day. After hours with Sri Yukteswar, listening to his incomparable flow of wisdom, or helping with ashram duties, I would reluctantly depart around midnight for the <em>Panthi</em> . Occasionally I stayed all night with my guru, so happily engrossed in his conversation that I scarcely noticed when darkness changed into dawn.</p><p>One night about eleven o'clock, as I was putting on my shoes  in preparation for the ride to the boardinghouse, Master questioned me gravely.</p><p>"When do your A.B. examinations start?"</p><p>"Five days hence, sir."</p></div> </div>
