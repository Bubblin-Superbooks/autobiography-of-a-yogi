I rejoice that his little school has now grown to an international university, "Viswa-Bharati," where scholars of all lands have found an ideal setting.</p><blockquote><p>"Where the mind is without fear and the head is held high;
Where knowledge is free;
Where the world has not been broken up into fragments by
     narrow domestic walls;
Where words come out from the depth of truth;
Where tireless striving stretches its arms toward perfection;
Where the clear stream of reason has not lost its way into the
     dreary desert sand of dead habit;
Where the mind is led forward by Thee into ever-widening
     thought and action;
Into that heaven of freedom, my Father, let my country
     awake!" </p></blockquote><hr class="section"></div> </div>
