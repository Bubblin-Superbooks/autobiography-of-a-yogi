He proves mathematically that the velocity of light is, so far as man's finite mind is concerned, the only <em>constant</em> in a universe of unstayable flux. On the sole absolute of light-velocity depend all human standards of time and space. Not abstractly eternal as hitherto considered, time and space are relative and finite factors, deriving their measurement validity only in reference to the yardstick of light-velocity. In joining space as a dimensional relativity, time has surrendered age- old claims to a changeless value. Time is now stripped to its rightful nature-a simple essence of ambiguity! With a few equational strokes of his pen, Einstein has banished from the cosmos every fixed reality except that of light.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">In a later development, his Unified Field Theory, the</p></div> </div>
