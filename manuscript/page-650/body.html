The atoms in the crystal lattice of the tungsten appeared on the fluorescent screen as points of light, arranged in geometric pattern. Against this crystal cube of light the bombarding molecules of air could be observed as dancing points of light, similar to points of sunlight shimmering on moving waters. . . .</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"The principle of the electron microscope was first discovered in 1927 by Drs. Clinton J. Davisson and Lester H.
