Gravitation, whether the "force" of Newton or the Einsteinian "manifestation of inertia," is powerless to <em>compel</em> a master to exhibit the property of "weight" which is the distinguishing gravitational condition of all material objects. He who knows himself as the omnipresent Spirit is subject no longer to the rigidities of a body in time and space. Their imprisoning "rings-pass-not" have yielded to the solvent: "I am He."</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Fiat lux! And there was light."
