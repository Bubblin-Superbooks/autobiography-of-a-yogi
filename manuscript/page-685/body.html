Justice is blind; the outwitted police decided to follow her example.</p><p>The great yogi preserved a habitual silence.  In spite of his round face and huge, barrel-like stomach, Trailanga ate only occasionally. After weeks without food, he would break his fast with potfuls of clabbered milk offered to him by devotees. A skeptic once determined to expose Trailanga as a charlatan. A large bucket of calcium-lime mixture, used in whitewashing walls, was placed before the swami.</p><p>"Master," the materialist said, in mock reverence, "I have brought you some clabbered milk. Please drink it."</p><p>Trailanga unhesitatingly drained, to the last drop, the containerful of burning lime. In a few minutes the evildoer fell to the ground in agony.</p><p>"Help, swami, help!" he cried. "I am on fire! Forgive my wicked test!"</p></div> </div>
