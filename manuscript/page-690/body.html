<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>This woman saint often visited Lahiri Mahasaya. She has related that one day, in the Barackpur section near Calcutta, while she was sitting by Lahiri Mahasaya's side, his great guru Babaji quietly entered the room and held converse with them both.</p><p>On one occasion her master Trailanga, forsaking his usual silence, honored Lahiri Mahasaya very pointedly in public. A Benares disciple objected.</p><p>"Sir," he said, "why do you, a swami and a renunciate, show such respect to a householder?"</p><p>"My son," Trailanga replied, "Lahiri Mahasaya is like a divine kitten, remaining wherever the Cosmic Mother has placed him. While dutifully playing the part of a worldly man, he has received that perfect self- realization for which I have renounced even my loincloth!"</p><p>‚ùÅ One is reminded here of Milton's line: "He for God only, she for God in him."</p></div> </div>
