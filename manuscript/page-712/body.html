The secluded master has retained his physical form for centuries, perhaps for millenniums. The deathless Babaji is an <em>avatara</em>. This Sanskrit word means "descent"; its roots are <em>ava</em>, "down," and <em>tri</em>, "to pass." In the Hindu scriptures, <em>avatara</em> signifies the descent of Divinity into flesh.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Babaji's spiritual state is beyond human</p></div> </div>
