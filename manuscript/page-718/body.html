<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">Creator, the sole but silent Power, Babaji works in a humble obscurity.</p><p>Great prophets like Christ and Krishna come to earth for a specific and spectacular purpose; they depart as soon as it is accomplished. Other avatars, like Babaji, undertake work which is concerned more with the slow evolutionary progress of man during the centuries than with any one outstanding event of history. Such masters always veil themselves from the gross public gaze, and have the power to become invisible at will. For these reasons, and because they generally instruct their disciples to maintain silence about them, a number of towering spiritual figures remain world-unknown. I give in these pages on Babaji merely a hint of his life-only a few facts which he deems it fit and helpful to be publicly imparted.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">No limiting facts about Babaji's family or birthplace, dear to the annalist's heart, have ever been discovered.</p></div> </div>
