Thy prayer cannot be granted."</p><p>"Lord," I said, grief-stricken, "Thou dost not wish to engage with me in a 'tug of war' at Puri, where Thou wilt have to deny my incessant prayers for Master's life. Must he, then, depart for higher duties at Thy behest?"</p><p>In obedience to the inward command, I did not leave that night for Puri. The following evening I set out for the train; on the way, at seven o'clock, a black astral cloud suddenly covered the sky.  Later, while the train roared toward Puri, a vision of Sri Yukteswar appeared before me. He was sitting, very grave of countenance, with a light on each side.</p><p>"Is it all over?" I lifted my arms beseechingly.</p><p>He nodded, then slowly vanished.</p><p>As I stood on the Puri train platform the following morning, still hoping against hope, an unknown man approached me.</p></div> </div>
