Groveling, man knows well; despair is seldom alien; yet these are perversities, no part of man's true lot. The day he wills, he is set on the path to freedom. Too long has he hearkened to the dank pessimism of his "dust-thou-art" counselors, heedless of the unconquerable soul.</p><p>I was not the only one privileged to behold the Resurrected Guru.</p><p>One of Sri Yukteswar's chelas was an aged woman, affectionately known as <em>Ma</em> (Mother), whose home was close to the Puri hermitage. Master had often stopped to chat with her during his morning walk. On the evening of March 16, 1936, Ma arrived at the ashram and asked to see her guru.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">"Why, Master died a week ago!" Swami Sebananda,</p></div> </div>
