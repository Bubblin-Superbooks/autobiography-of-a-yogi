<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p class="no-indent  ">my heart!

By continuous meditation, he reaches the superior state of <em>nirbikalpa samadhi</em>, where he moves freely in the world and performs his outward duties without any loss of God-realization.</p><p>❁ Sri Yukteswar used the word <em>prana</em>; I have translated it as lifetrons. The Hindu scriptures refer not only to the <em>anu</em>, "atom," and to the <em>paramanu</em>, "beyond the atom," finer electronic energies; but also to <em>prana</em>, "creative lifetronic force." Atoms and electrons are blind forces; <em>prana</em> is inherently intelligent. The pranic lifetrons in the spermatozoa and ova, for instance, guide the embryonic development according to a karmic design.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line ">❁ Adjective of <em>mantra</em>, chanted seed-sounds</p></div> </div>
