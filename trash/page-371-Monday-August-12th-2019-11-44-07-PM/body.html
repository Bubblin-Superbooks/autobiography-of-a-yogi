<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>These Biblical words refer to the threefold nature of God as Father, Son, Holy Ghost (<em>Sat</em> , <em>Tat</em> , <em>Aum</em> in the Hindu scriptures). God the Father is the Absolute, Unmanifested, existing <em>beyond</em> vibratory creation. God the Son is the Christ Consciousness (Brahma or <em>Kutastha</em> <em>Chaitanya</em> ) existing <em>within</em> vibratory creation; this Christ Consciousness is the "only begotten" or sole reflection of the Uncreated Infinite. Its outward manifestation or "witness" is <em>Aum</em> or Holy Ghost, the divine, creative, invisible power which structures all creation through vibration. <em>Aum</em> the blissful Comforter is heard in meditation and reveals to the devotee the ultimate Truth.</p></div> </div>
