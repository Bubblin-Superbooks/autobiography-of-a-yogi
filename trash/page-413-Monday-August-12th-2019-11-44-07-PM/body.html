Its message is rather a prod to pride; the very heavens seek to arouse man's determination to be free from every limitation. God created each man as a soul, dowered with individuality, hence essential to the universal structure, whether in the temporary role of pillar or parasite. His freedom is final and immediate, if he so wills; it depends not on outer but inner victories.</p><p>Sri Yukteswar discovered the mathematical application of a 24,000-year equinoctial cycle to our present age.  The cycle is divided into an Ascending Arc and a Descending Arc, each of 12,000 years. Within each Arc fall four <em>Yugas</em> or Ages, called <em>Kali</em> , <em>Dwapara</em> , <em>Treta</em> , and <em>Satya</em> , corresponding to the Greek ideas of Iron, Bronze, Silver, and Golden Ages.</p></div> </div>
