A crestfallen Dijen soon entered the room.</p><p>"Master was not on the nine o'clock train, nor even the nine-thirty." My friend made his announcement with a slightly apologetic air.</p><p>"Come then; I know he will arrive at ten o'clock." I took Dijen's hand and rushed him forcibly along with me, heedless of his protests. In about ten minutes we entered the station, where the train was already puffing to a halt.</p><p>"The whole train is filled with the light of Master's aura! He is there!" I exclaimed joyfully.</p><p>"You dream so?" Dijen laughed mockingly.</p><p>"Let us wait here." I told my friend details of the way in which our guru would approach us. As I finished my description, Sri Yukteswar came into view, wearing the same clothes I had seen a short time earlier. He walked slowly in the wake of a small lad bearing a silver jug.</p></div> </div>
