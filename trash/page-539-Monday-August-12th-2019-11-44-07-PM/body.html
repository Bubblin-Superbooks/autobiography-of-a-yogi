"I will make you a swami in the <em>bidwat</em> (non-ceremonious) manner."</p><p>The <em>bibidisa</em> or elaborate initiation into swamiship includes a fire ceremony, during which symbolical funeral rites are performed. The physical body of the disciple is represented as dead, cremated in the flame of wisdom. The newly-made swami is then given a chant, such as: "This <em>atma</em> is Brahma"  or "Thou art That" or "I am He." Sri Yukteswar, however, with his love of simplicity, dispensed with all formal rites and merely asked me to select a new name.</p></div> </div>
