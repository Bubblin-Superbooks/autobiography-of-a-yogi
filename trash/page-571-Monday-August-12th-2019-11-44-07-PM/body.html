The atoms of this extra oxygen are transmuted into life current to rejuvenate the brain and spinal centers.  By stopping the accumulation of venous blood, the yogi is able to lessen or prevent the decay of tissues; the advanced yogi transmutes his cells into pure energy. Elijah, Jesus, Kabir and other prophets were past masters in the use of <em>Kriya</em> or a similar technique, by which they caused their bodies to dematerialize at will.</p><p class=" stretch-last-line "><em>Kriya</em> is an ancient science.
