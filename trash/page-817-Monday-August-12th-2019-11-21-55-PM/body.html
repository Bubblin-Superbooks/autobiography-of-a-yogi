<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>The ancient name for India is <em>Aryavarta</em>, literally, "abode of the Aryans." The Sanskrit root of <em>arya</em> is "worthy, holy, noble." The later ethnological misuse of <em>Aryan</em> to signify not spiritual, but physical, characteristics, led the great Orientalist, Max Muller, to say quaintly: "To me an ethnologist who speaks of an Aryan race, Aryan blood, Aryan eyes and hair, is as great a sinner as a linguist who speaks of a dolichocephalic dictionary or a brachycephalic grammar."</p><p>❁ <em>param-guru</em> is literally "guru supreme" or "guru beyond," signifying a line or succession of teachers. Babaji, the <em>guru</em> of Lahiri Mahasaya, was the <em>param-guru</em> of Sri Yukteswar.</p><p>❁ My visit to Keshabananda's ashram is described on pp. 405-408.</p><p>❁ September 26, 1895 is the date on which Lahiri Mahasaya left his body. In a few more days he would have reached his sixty-eighth birthday.</p></div> </div>
