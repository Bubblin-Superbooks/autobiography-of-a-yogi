<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Child of my heart, O Yogananda!</p><p>Seeing the photos of your school and students, what joy comes in my life I cannot express in words. I am melting in joy to see your yoga students of different cities. Beholding your methods in chant affirmations, healing vibrations, and divine healing prayers, I cannot refrain from thanking you from my heart. Seeing the gate, the winding hilly way upward, and the beautiful scenery spread out beneath the Mount Washington Estates, I yearn to behold it all with my own eyes.</p><p>Everything here is going on well. Through the grace of God, may you ever be in bliss.</p><hr class="section"></div> </div>
