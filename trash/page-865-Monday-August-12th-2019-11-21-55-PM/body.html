How simple her reply, how Einsteinian!</p><p>"I see you realize that energy flows to your body from the ether, sun, and air."</p><p>A swift smile broke over her face.

"It is indeed so. One of the reasons I am here on earth today is to prove that man can live by God's invisible light, and not by food only."</p><p>"Can you teach others how to live without food?"</p><p>She appeared a trifle shocked. "I cannot do that; God does not wish it."</p></div> </div>
