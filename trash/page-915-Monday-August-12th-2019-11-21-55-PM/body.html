<div class="leaf "><div class="inner justify"><p>Alexander invited to Taxila a number of Brahmin ascetics noted for their skill in answering philosophical questions with pithy wisdom. An account of the verbal skirmish is given by Plutarch; Alexander himself framed all the questions.</p><p>"Which be the more numerous, the living or the dead?"</p><p>"The living, for the dead are not."</p><p>"Which breeds the larger animals, the sea or the land?"</p><p>"The land, for the sea is only a part of land."</p><p>"Which is the cleverest of beasts?"</p><p>"That one with which man is not yet acquainted." (Man fears the unknown.)</p><p>"Which existed first, the day or the night?"</p><p>"The day was first by one day." This reply caused Alexander to betray surprise; the Brahmin added: "Impossible questions require impossible answers."</p></div> </div>
